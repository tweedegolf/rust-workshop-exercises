fn main() {
    // Write a function that reads inputs from `input.json`
    // Take a look at the format of input.json
    // Hint: we've included an external library for parsing JSON
    // This should result in a vector with all the data from `input.json`

    // Then for each number between 0 and 9 count the number of occurences of
    // that number in the input.

    // Finally output the counts for each of the buckets

    // Bonus: Write some tests to validate your occurence counting function
