fn main() {
    // Write a little in memory task todo application

    // Start by defining some types. Each todo task should consist of:
    // - title
    // - a status (todo, doing, done)
    // - expected duration

    // When the program starts, the user should be prompted to pick between
    // several actions:
    // - create a task (lets the user enter a title and expected duration)
    // - mark a task active
    // - mark the active task completed
    // - clear completed tasks

    // Bonus: store the tasks on disk every time something changes and read
    // them from disk on program startup

    // Bonus 2: add an extra action to let the user know the remaining time
    // since starting the task based on the expected duration and the starting
    // time of the task
}
